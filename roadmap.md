# Roadmap

- [ ] iOS is built and parked, not shipping yet -- 2026-08-30. A new bundle ID for a
  single-book reader is the exact shape Apple rejected seven times in the open
  4.3(a) wave, and the 5.6 suspension only lifted 2026-08-18. Revisit
  `com.heyitsmejosh.fengshui` registration once those replies resolve.
- [ ] Consider macOS target once iOS is stable (see uprighty/ios/project.yml for the pattern)
- [ ] Mirror the assessment into iOS. Web became an assessment tool 2026-08-30; `ios/FengShui`
  is still reader-only, so the platforms have diverged. Do this when the 4.3(a) wave resolves
  and the app can actually ship -- an assessment tool is also a better answer to 4.3(a) than a
  single-book reader was.
- [ ] Add more chapter content beyond the single Good Fengshui summary if the app grows

## WebMCP + REST API rollout -- assessed and closed 2026-08-27

Not doing this here. Static long-form reader. Table of contents and scroll-jump only; nothing is created or saved.

A tool on a page like this would be `get_page_content`, which spends an
agent's context restating text it can already read. That is noise, not
coverage, and it makes the honest tools in the other repos harder to find.

Shipped instead in: epiphany, healstack, roost, curvely, wiretext, litigate,
cadence, sparkjar, lexly, talli, quotable, wordroot, newsline, nyc, notes,
bookrank, homeward.

**Reopen 2026-08-30.** The premise above no longer holds -- the page now saves an
assessment, so there is real state an agent could read and write
(`get_assessment` / `answer_question`). Worth a second look, not urgent.
